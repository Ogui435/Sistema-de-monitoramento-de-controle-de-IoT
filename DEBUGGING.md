Troubleshooting
===============

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

* Whie creating the Notebook make sure you chose Python 2.0, Spark as the environment.
  The default will be Python.
* Make sure the import ran correctly. You might need to restart the
  kernel and run the cells from the top.
* Many of the cells rely on variables that are set in earlier cells. Some of
  these are cleared in later cells. Start over at the top when troubleshooting.
* Many of the cells rely on service credentials from Bluemix that are set in
  earlier cells. Make sure to add your service credentials correctly.
